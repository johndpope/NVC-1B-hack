    with torch.no_grad():
        # Read video frames
        frames = read_video(input_video_path)

        # Initialize variables
        bitstream = []

        for t in range(len(frames)):
            x_t = frames[t]
            if t == 0:
                # Intra-frame coding for the first frame
                compressed_frame = intra_frame_encoder(x_t)
            else:
                x_t_minus_1 = frames[t - 1]
                # Perform motion estimation, encoding, etc.
                compressed_frame = inter_frame_encoder(x_t, x_t_minus_1)

            # Append compressed data to bitstream
            bitstream.append(compressed_frame)

    # Save bitstream to file
    save_bitstream(output_bitstream_path, bitstream)

def decode_video(input_bitstream_path, output_video_path):
    # Initialize modules
    model.eval()
    with torch.no_grad():
        # Load bitstream
        bitstream = load_bitstream(input_bitstream_path)

        # Initialize variables
        reconstructed_frames = []

        for t in range(len(bitstream)):
            compressed_frame = bitstream[t]
            if t == 0:
                # Intra-frame decoding for the first frame
                x_t_hat = intra_frame_decoder(compressed_frame)
            else:
                # Perform motion decoding, reconstruction, etc.
                x_t_hat = inter_frame_decoder(compressed_frame, reconstructed_frames[t - 1])

            # Append reconstructed frame
            reconstructed_frames.append(x_t_hat)

    # Save reconstructed frames as video
    write_video(output_video_path, reconstructed_frames)
Step 11: Optimize and Test the Model
Objective: Ensure the model is efficient and meets performance expectations.

Actions:

Profile the Model:
Use tools like PyTorch's profiler to identify bottlenecks.
Optimize Code:

Example of Mixed-Precision Training:

python
Copy code
scaler = torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler()

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()

        with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():
            # Forward pass
            outputs = model(inputs)
            loss = compute_loss(outputs, targets)

        # Backward pass
        scaler.scale(loss).backward()
        scaler.step(optimizer)
        scaler.update()
Additional Tips
Modularize Code:

Organize code into separate modules or classes for each component (e.g., motion_estimation.py, entropy_model.py).
Version Control:

Use Git for code management and collaboration.
Regularly commit changes with meaningful messages.
Documentation:

Write docstrings for classes and functions.
Comment complex code sections for clarity.
Experiment Tracking:

Use tools like TensorBoard or Weights & Biases to monitor training metrics and visualize losses.
Resource Management:

Be mindful of GPU memory usage.
Use gradient checkpointing or FRB to handle large models.
Testing:

Write unit tests for individual modules.
Validate outputs at each stage to catch errors early.
Data Handling:

Ensure proper handling of video formats (RGB vs. YUV420).
Use FFmpeg for any necessary format conversions.
By following this recipe, you will systematically implement the NVC-1B model, ensuring that each component aligns with the architecture described in your paper. Remember to validate each module individually before integrating them to simplify debugging and verification. Good luck with your implementation!
